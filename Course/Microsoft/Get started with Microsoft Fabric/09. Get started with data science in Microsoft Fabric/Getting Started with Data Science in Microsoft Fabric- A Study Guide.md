- **Collaboration:** Facilitate teamwork with other data engineers and analysts on shared data and projects.

### 2. Understanding the Data Science Process in Fabric

The typical data science process in Microsoft Fabric often aligns with standard industry practices, leveraging Fabric's integrated capabilities at each stage:

1. **Data Acquisition & Ingestion:**
    - **Source:** Connect to various data sources using Data Factory pipelines or Dataflows Gen2 to ingest raw data into a Lakehouse.
    - **Lakehouse:** The primary storage for raw and refined data, providing flexible schema and scalable storage (Delta Lake format).
2. **Data Exploration & Preparation (EDA & Feature Engineering):**
    - **Notebooks:** Use Spark-powered notebooks (PySpark, Pandas on Spark) to load data from the Lakehouse into DataFrames.
    - **Data Wrangling:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), clean data, handle missing values, and engineer new features. Fabric notebooks may integrate with tools like Data Wrangler for visual data preparation and code generation.
    - **Visualization:** Use built-in visualization tools or libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly in notebooks.
3. **Model Training & Experimentation:**
    - **Notebooks:** Write and execute code to train machine learning models.
    - **Libraries:** Utilize popular ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, Spark MLlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
    - **MLflow Integration:** Track experiments, log parameters, metrics, and models using MLflow.
4. **Model Evaluation & Tuning:**
    - **Notebooks:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.).
    - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques or libraries (e.g., Hyperopt with Spark) for hyperparameter optimization.
5. **Model Registration & Management:**
    - **MLflow Model Registry:** Register trained models with the MLflow Model Registry in Fabric for versioning and lifecycle management.
    - **Model Item:** Fabric provides a dedicated "Model" item to manage registered models.
6. **Model Deployment & Operationalization:**
    - **Batch Inference:** Apply models to new data in batch mode using notebooks or pipelines.
    - **Real-time Inference (Future/External):** While not explicitly covered in basic modules, Fabric's broader ecosystem supports real-time serving through other Azure services.
7. **Monitoring & Retraining:** (Beyond the scope of initial modules) Monitor model performance in production and trigger retraining as needed.

### 3. Practical Steps: Training Models with Notebooks in Microsoft Fabric

Notebooks are the primary workspace for data scientists in Fabric.

#### a. Accessing and Preparing Data:

1. **Create a New Notebook:** In your Fabric workspace, navigate to "Data Science" and select "New notebook," or open an existing notebook associated with a Lakehouse.
2. **Attach to Lakehouse:** Ensure your notebook is attached to a Lakehouse. This provides direct access to data stored in Delta tables and files within OneLake.
3. **Load Data:** Use Spark (PySpark is common) to load data from your Lakehouse into a DataFrame.
    ```Python
    # Example: Load a Delta table from the Lakehouse
    df = spark.read.format("delta").table("your_lakehouse_name.your_delta_table_name")
    
    # Or load a CSV file directly from the Files section
    # df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("Files/path/to/your_data.csv")
    
    display(df) # To view a sample of the DataFrame
    ```
    
4. **Data Preparation:** Perform necessary cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering using PySpark or Pandas on Spark DataFrames.
    ```Python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import col, when
    
    # Example: Handle missing values
    df_cleaned = df.na.drop()
    
    # Example: Create a new feature
    df_features = df_cleaned.withColumn("new_feature", col("existing_feature") * 2)
    display(df_features)
    ```

#### b. Training Machine Learning Models:

1. **Choose ML Library:** Select an appropriate machine learning library (e.g., `scikit-learn` for smaller datasets that fit in memory, `Spark MLlib` for distributed training on large datasets).
2. **Define Model:**
    ```Python
    # Example with scikit-learn (often run on a single node after .toPandas())
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    
    # Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame for scikit-learn
    # For large data, consider sampling or using Spark MLlib directly
    pandas_df = df_features.toPandas()
    X = pandas_df[['feature1', 'feature2']]
    y = pandas_df['target_column']
    
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
    ```
    
    ```Python
    # Example with Spark MLlib (for distributed training)
    from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
    from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
    from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator
    
    # Prepare features for Spark MLlib
    assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["feature1", "feature2"], outputCol="features")
    data_assembled = assembler.transform(df_features)
    
    # Train-test split
    (training_data, test_data) = data_assembled.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3], seed=42)
    
    # Train model
    lr = LogisticRegression(labelCol="target_column", featuresCol="features")
    lr_model = lr.fit(training_data)
    
    # Evaluate model
    predictions = lr_model.transform(test_data)
    evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="target_column", rawPredictionCol="rawPrediction")
    auc = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
    print(f"Area Under ROC Curve: {auc}")
    ```
    

### 4. Tracking Model Training with MLflow and Experiments

Microsoft Fabric seamlessly integrates with **MLflow**, an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This allows data scientists to track experiments, log parameters, metrics, and artifacts (models).

#### a. Logging Experiments in Fabric:

- **Automatic Logging:** Fabric notebooks often have auto-logging enabled for popular ML libraries, which automatically logs parameters, metrics, and models to MLflow experiments.
- **Manual Logging:** For more control, you can manually log using the MLflow API.
    ```Python
    import mlflow
    import mlflow.sklearn # or mlflow.spark, etc.
    
    # Set the experiment name (optional, if not using default)
    # mlflow.set_experiment("My_Fabric_ML_Experiment")
    
    with mlflow.start_run() as run:
        # Log parameters
        mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)
        mlflow.log_param("epochs", 100)
    
        # Train your model (e.g., LogisticRegression as above)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Using scikit-learn example
    
        # Log metrics
        mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
    
        # Log the model
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "logistic_regression_model")
    
        run_id = run.info.run_id
        print(f"MLflow Run ID: {run_id}")
    ```
   

#### b. Viewing Experiments:

- **Fabric Experiment View:** In the Fabric Data Science experience, you can find an "Experiments" section where you can view your MLflow runs, compare metrics, and explore logged artifacts. Each notebook run with MLflow logging creates a new experiment run.

### 5. Model Management and Deployment (Introduction)

- **MLflow Model Registry:** Fabric leverages the MLflow Model Registry for managing the lifecycle of your models. After training and logging a model, you can register it.
    
    ```Python
    # Register the model logged in the run (example based on run_id from above)
    model_uri = f"runs:/{run_id}/logistic_regression_model"
    registered_model = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "My_Registered_Logistic_Model")
    print(f"Model Version: {registered_model.version}")
    ```
    
- **Fabric Model Item:** Registered models appear as "Model" items in your Fabric workspace, allowing for versioning, adding descriptions, and transitioning model stages (e.g., Staging, Production).
- **Batch Inference:** For deployment, data scientists often use notebooks or pipelines to load registered models and perform batch predictions on new data stored in the Lakehouse.
    
    ```Python
    # Load a registered model for inference
    loaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/My_Registered_Logistic_Model/{registered_model.version}")
    predictions_df = loaded_model.predict(X_new_data)
    ```

### 6. Collaboration

Fabric enhances collaboration by:

- **Shared Workspace:** All team members work within a shared Fabric workspace, accessing the same Lakehouses, notebooks, and models.
- **Unified Data:** A single source of truth for data through OneLake.
- **Version Control:** Notebooks can be integrated with Git for version control.

### Exercise / Practice Points

- Create a new Data Science notebook in your Fabric workspace and attach it to a Lakehouse.
- Load a sample dataset (e.g., from a CSV file in your Lakehouse or a public dataset).
- Perform basic data exploration and preparation steps using PySpark (e.g., `df.describe()`, `df.filter()`).
